sp: split and run in parallel

Usage: sp <TEMPLATE> :: [SUBSTITUTION]...
       sp [COMMAND] :: [COMMAND] :: ... :: [COMMAND]

Description:

    Runs any number of commands in parallel. Waits until all of those commands
    finish. Exits with the highest status code returned by any of the commands.

Template:

  The <TEMPLATE> variant runs variants of <TEMPLATE> in parallel, once for each
  [SUBSTITUTION], with any {} in [TEMPLATE] replaced with the [SUBSTITUTION].

  Example:

    Run 'echo 1', 'echo 2' and 'echo 3' in parallel

        sp echo {} :: 1 2 3

    Run 'echo 1 1', 'echo 2 2' and 'echo 3 3' in parallel

        sp echo {} {} :: 1 2 3

Command:

  The [COMMAND]... variant runs each [COMMAND], separated by ::, in parallel.

    Run 'echo 1', 'echo 2' and 'echo 3' in parallel without a template

        sp echo 1 :: echo 2 :: echo 3

    Run a, b, and c in parallel

        sp a foo bar :: "b 'baz  bar'" :: c
